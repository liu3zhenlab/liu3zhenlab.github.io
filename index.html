<p>Welcome to Liu lab at the <a href="https://plantpath.ksu.edu">Department of Plant Pathology</a> at <a href="https://ksu.edu">Kansas State University</a>. Our lab primarily utilizes next generation sequencing technology and bioinformatics tools to address biological questions of interest. Our research is focused on plant embryogenesis / regeneration, plant / microbial genomics, and plant resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Our current interests include the utility of multiple cutting-edge technologies for genome assembly, methodologies in efficient gene mapping and cloning, understanding plant responses at the molecular level to abiotic stresses (e.g. drought condition), as well as identification of critical genes involved in embryogenesis / regeneration and resistant genes to various pathogens in maize and wheat.</p>
