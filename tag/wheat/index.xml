      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;wheat-leaf-rust-and-yellow-rust&#34;&gt;Wheat Leaf Rust and Yellow Rust&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene mapping is a process to find trait-associated genetic markers. The gene
mapping process is an important step towards identifying genes responsible for
phenotypic traits. In wheat, identification of effective (or polymorphic)
genetic markers and gene mapping are tedious. The BSR-Seq analysis, combining
RNA-Seq and bulked segregant analysis, was developed and has been successfully
used to facilitate mapping and cloning many genes in species other than wheat.
This project is to adapt this method to the wheat system. Currently, we are
applying BSR-Seq to map several genes in wheat, including leaf rust gene Lr42
and several unknown yellow rust genes in a diploid wild relative of wheat.&lt;/p&gt;
