Welcome to Liu lab at the [Department of Plant Pathology][plpath] at [Kansas
State University][ksu]. Our lab primarily utilizes next generation sequencing
technology and bioinformatics tools to address biological questions of interest.
Our research is focused on plant embryogenesis / regeneration, plant / microbial
genomics, and plant resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Our current
interests include the utility of multiple cutting-edge technologies for genome
assembly, methodologies in efficient gene mapping and cloning, understanding
plant responses at the molecular level to abiotic stresses (e.g. drought
condition), as well as identification of critical genes involved in
embryogenesis / regeneration and resistant genes to various pathogens in maize
and wheat.

# Research Interests
- Plant embryogenesis and regeneration
- Plant structural variation and its impact on phenotypic traits
- Cloning and characterization of pathogen resistant genes, drought resistant
  genes, and other important crop genes
- Assembly and annotation of plant and microbial genomes
- Adaptation of cutting-edge genomic technologies to facilitate plant genetic
  and genomic studies
